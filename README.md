# f21-foobar
Sample solutions in Python for Google's Foobar challenge. Foobar consists of five different stages, each with a variety of problems; I've attached the Python code I wrote that passed each of the questions.

Each file contains solutions to the problems for that respective stage. Stages 1 and 5 have one question each; stages 2 and 4 have two questions each; and stage 3 has three questions.
